# This file FindYARP.cmake is created at Almende B.V. It is open-source software and part
# of the Common Hybrid Agent Platform (CHAP). A toolbox with a lot of open-source tools.
# Ranging from thread pools, and TCP/IP components to control architectures and learning
# algorithms. This software is published under the GNU Lesser General Public license, under
# version 3 (or later). You can find a version of the license on Debian (derived) systems at
# /usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-3.

# It is not possible to add usage restrictions to a free open-source license. Nevertheless, we
# personally strongly object against this software used by the military, in the bio-industry, 
# for animal experimentation, or anything that violates the Universal Declaration of Human 
# Rights. This is, again, no usage restriction, it is a non-binding recommendation.

#  YARP_FOUND        - system has YARP installed
#  YARP_INCLUDE_DIRS - the YARP include directories
#  YARP_LIBRARIES    - link these to use YARP
#  YARP_HAS_NAME_LIB - indicate existence of nameserver lib
#  YARP_HAS_MATH_LIB - indicate existence of math lib

# This script uses LIST APPEND which does only exist for cmake >= 2.4
